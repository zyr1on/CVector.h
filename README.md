# CVector.h – Simple & Safe Generic Vector Header Only Library for C 

This header-only library provides a fast, safe, and easy-to-use generic dynamic array (vector) implementation for C. With modern features and robust error checks, you can enjoy the flexibility of C++-style vectors right in C, with zero dependencies and zero runtime overhead for most operations.

---

## Features

-  **Type-safe Macros:** Create vectors of any type with compile-time safety.
-  **Branch Prediction and Fast Growth:** Uses bitwise tricks for efficient resizing.
-  **Debug Checks:** Catches double init/free, out-of-bounds, and misuse.
-  **No Hidden Allocations:** All memory management is explicit and safe.

```c
// "This header file can be found in src/CVector.h."

# Benchmark Results: CVector vs std::vector  

This benchmark compares the performance of a custom C vector implementation (`CVector`) against C++'s standard library vector (`std::vector`) when pushing back 1,000,000 integer elements. The test was repeated 5 times for each vector type, and the durations were measured using `std::chrono`. Below is a summary of the results:

| push_back()   | CVector (ms) | std::vector (ms) |
|-------|--------------|------------------|
| 1     | 2.0348       | 5.9383           |
| 2     | 1.9931       | 6.9766           |
| 3     | 2.9904       | 5.9795           |
| 4     | 1.9930       | 5.9806           |
| 5     | 1.9932       | 5.9800           |
| **Average** | **2.2009** | **6.1710**         |

---

- **Test Method**: Both vectors were tested by sequentially adding 1,000,000 integers using their respective `push_back` methods. Each test was repeated 5 times to reduce measurement noise.


# Benchmark Results: CVector vs std::vector middle pos

This benchmark measures the performance of inserting elements into the **middle** of a vector for both a custom C vector implementation (`CVector`) and C++'s standard library vector (`std::vector`). Each vector had 100,000 elements inserted one-by-one into the middle, and the test was repeated 5 times for each implementation. Times are reported in milliseconds (ms).

| insert()   | CVector (ms) | std::vector (ms) |
|-------|--------------|------------------|
| 1     | 140.530      | 143.115          |
| 2     | 135.547      | 137.540          |
| 3     | 136.541      | 136.543          |
| 4     | 136.543      | 137.540          |
| 5     | 139.533      | 140.748          |
| **Average** | **137.739** | **139.097**         |

- **Test Method:** Each vector starts empty. For each of 100,000 iterations, an element is inserted at the current middle position (`size / 2`).
